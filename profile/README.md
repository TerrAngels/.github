# TerrAngels

**Autonomous systems for environmental restoration at scale.**

We develop drone technology that addresses environmental challenges beyond human capacity to solve manually—enabling precision agriculture, ecosystem restoration, and real-time monitoring across landscapes that were previously inaccessible.

### Mission

Environmental degradation is outpacing our ability to respond. TerrAngels closes that gap with purpose-built autonomous systems that restore ecosystems, optimize agricultural operations, and provide actionable intelligence from the sky.

### Capabilities

- **Precision Agriculture** — Optimizing inputs, reducing waste, and improving yields through targeted application and continuous monitoring
- **Reforestation & Restoration** — Delivering native species to degraded and remote landscapes at scale
- **Environmental Monitoring** — Real-time ecological assessment, change detection, and data collection for informed decision-making

### Approach

We combine edge computing, satellite connectivity, and advanced sensing to operate autonomously at scale. Our systems are designed for the environments that matter most: forests, agricultural land, and ecosystems requiring intervention.
