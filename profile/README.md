# 🌿 TerrAngels

**Drone manufacturing for environmental restoration.**

We build autonomous systems that restore ecosystems at scale — reforestation, invasive species management, and precision conservation from the sky.

### Our Mission

The planet faces environmental challenges that exceed human capacity to address manually. TerrAngels bridges that gap with drone technology purpose-built for restoration work.

### What We Build

- **Seed dispersal systems** — Delivering native species to remote and degraded landscapes
- **Precision monitoring** — Real-time ecological assessment and change detection  
- **Targeted treatment** — Applying treatments exactly where needed, minimizing waste and impact

### Based in Hawaiʻi 🌺

Our home islands are a living laboratory for restoration technology. From invasive species threatening native forests to post-wildfire recovery, Hawaiʻi's challenges inform everything we design.
