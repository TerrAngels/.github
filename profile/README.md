**Autonomous robotics & AI for environmental systems.**

We build intelligent machines that operate where humans can't—autonomously restoring ecosystems, optimizing agricultural operations, and generating real-time environmental intelligence at planetary scale.

## Core Technology

### Autonomous Flight Systems
Fully autonomous drone platforms with swarm coordination, real-time path planning, and edge computing. Our systems operate independently in GPS-denied environments, coordinate multi-vehicle missions, and adapt dynamically to changing conditions without human intervention.

### AI & Machine Learning
Computer vision for species identification, terrain analysis, and precision targeting. Predictive models for ecological forecasting and resource optimization. Intelligent decision-making systems that improve with every mission.

### Digital Twin Platform
Real-time environmental modeling and simulation. We construct living digital replicas of operational environments—integrating sensor data, satellite imagery, and ground truth to enable data-driven decision-making and predictive operations.

### Advanced Sensing
Multispectral imaging, LiDAR terrain mapping, and environmental sensor arrays. We capture data across the electromagnetic spectrum to understand ecosystems at a level of detail previously impossible.
